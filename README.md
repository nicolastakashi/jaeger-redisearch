## Why RediSearch

RediSearch is a [source-available](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/blob/master/LICENSE) Redis module that enables querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search for Redis. These features enable multi-field queries, aggregation, exact phrase matching, numeric filtering, and geo filtering for text queries.
